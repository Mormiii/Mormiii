- 👋 Hi, I’m Dora :)
- 👀 I’m interested in music producing (modular, VCV Rack), generative art (p5.js), classical instruments:cello, psychology, learning new things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, pytest.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects. Maybe something music related - visual graphics.
- Check the repository if you're interested in some of the projects I've worked on.
